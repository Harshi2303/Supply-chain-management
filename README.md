ABSTRACT:
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a supply chain dataset to predict product sales using advanced machine learning techniques. The process begins with meticulous data preprocessing, which includes converting date fields into numerical formats, eliminating irrelevant columns, and applying one-hot encoding to categorical features. The dataset is subsequently divided into training and testing sets to facilitate robust model evaluation.
Three regression models are employed: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Each model is trained on the training set, with predictions made on the test set. Performance is assessed using metrics such as R² score, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To enhance qualitative assessment, visualizations comparing predicted and actual values are generated, and a comprehensive summary of evaluation metrics is compiled for straightforward comparison.
In addition, the project leverages sophisticated techniques, including XGBoost and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to forecast product demand—an essential component for optimizing inventory levels and enhancing operational efficiency. The XGBoost model emphasizes feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies within sales data. Finally, an interactive Streamlit web application presents the findings i.e., the predictions, enabling users to explore visualizations and model results effectively. As an additional feature , Dijkstra’s algorithm was applied to manage the costs of delivery. This analysis uncovers valuable insights into sales trends and product performance, supporting informed decision-making in inventory management and strategic planning within the supply chain.
